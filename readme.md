### MOMENTUM:
A work in progress simple game engine, to write games for TI84+ CE line of graphing calculators. Written on top of Ti84+CE C/C++ toolchain. 

### USAGE:
Using the toolchain, ce-programming.github.io/toolchain, you will have to add the momentum folder to your src file. Make sure that if you use graphics.h, you have a folder named "gfx". Use the default folder of
gfx for an easy setup. 

### Newest version:
Currently, the only thing that I can do with it is to display a motionless sprite. 
WORK IN PROGRESS: Partial Redraw(moving sprites)
